<h2>About Myself</h2>
<p>My name is Rainier Angelo P. de Castro a 1st year student of silliman currently enrolled in the program Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I currently live in Motong Dumaguete City. 
During my free time I enjoy playing video games and working out.
I'm a first-year student at Silliman University, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I’m diving into the basics of programming, algorithms, and tech fundamentals, and 
I’m excited about the learning journey ahead. This early stage is all about exploring the field and building a solid foundation for my future studies and career.</p>

<p>The reason I chose this course is that I’ve been fascinated by technology from an early age. My interest in coding started in grade 10, and I quickly realized how much I enjoyed it.
This discovery motivated me to pursue a degree in Computer Science.I’m excited about the journey ahead and 
the opportunities to make a difference in the tech world.</p>
